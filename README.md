- 👋 Hi, I’m @doyxn! I'm an undergraduate student at Purdue University. 
 
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=doyxn&color=ededd1&style=plastic)

Interested in **backend systems, data pipelines, and ML infrastructure**. I previously worked with **AML/KYC Controls** @ JPMC, where I helped design rules-driven backend services, data pipelines, and internal tooling to support large-scale compliance systems.

My projects reflect what I’m currently learning and experimenting with — mostly at the intersection of **systems, data, and applied machine learning**.

###### Currently working on:
Sentiment Analysis — Faster Prediction Market Movement using NLP & ML

KJ-Orbital — an Electron app bringing Katherine Johnson’s technical papers into digital simulation --> [Technical Reports](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search?q=%22Johnson,%20Katherine%20G.%22)

###### Previously built:
Portfolio Site — built with React, hosted on GitHub Pages, with GitHub Actions auto-deploying blog posts from a separate repo.
